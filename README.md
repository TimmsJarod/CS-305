# CS-305 Week Eight Journal

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial approached a web development and security company to develop softaware security for their web application, including checksum verification.

#What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  I had little issue implementing functions that take advantage of java's native security features and did so using SHA3 encryption. which I deemed best suited the client's needs.

#What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  If it counts, the largest struggle I had while working with the software was handling out of date project files and making use of self signed certificates.
  
#How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

  I found implementing open source libraries gave a noticable advantage to adding security features that were relevant to the client's needs. Features such as managing protected rest clients, SQL protection, and offering high-end encryption.

#How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  Using the a third party vulnerability checker, i was able to ensure that the changes I was making to the software were not implmenting any additional problems that may result in a problem for the client later. Luckily this was not the case.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  I used industry standard tools like eclipse for the project. In addition, I also applied best practice to developing my code while also using generated reports from the previously mentioned depenency checker to ensure that the software was being developed securely.
  
#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  I would like for employers to look over my report and see that I was thorough while researching what the client's needs were and if my resolution was best suited to that problem.
